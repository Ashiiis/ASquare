<p>I'm falling in love with you
and i guess it scares me
because fronm the very beginning
i told myself not to.

part of me
the human part of me
is warning me to be careful
to not allow myself feel this way,
to protect myself
from getting hurt

but my soul...
my soul feels like
i am home, 
and there is no reason
to lock the door
because i am safe.</p>
